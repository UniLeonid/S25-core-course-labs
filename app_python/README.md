# Python Time Display Application

This application shows current time in the provided timezone at endpoint `/`.

Timezone, host and port by default are `Europe/Moscow`, '0.0.0.0' and '8080' respectively, but they can be changed
with command line arguments.

## Usage

```shell
git clone https://github.com/UniLeonid/S25-core-course-labs
git checkout origin/lab1
cd app_python
```

It is highly recommended to [use venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to avoid any possible problem
with package versions.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app_start.py
```

You can run `python app_start.py -h` to get information about all available arguments.
